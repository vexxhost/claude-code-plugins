# Commits

- Format: `type(scope): message`
- Scope SHOULD indicate the area of change
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`
- SHOULD be one logical change per commit - suggest splitting unrelated changes
- SHOULD explain why, not just what changed
- MUST use `git commit -s` to add DCO sign-off (do not add sign-off manually)
- MUST update PR body when adding follow-up commits to an open PR
